How to use

Features
========

This application has many features that make it differ from other applications and the internal Windows feature

Image filter
------------

Only images are read from the directory you select.
It will not attempt to read other files and will ignore corrupt images.

Accurate timer
--------------

User can freely chose from 5 seconds to 1 day how long to show a wallpaper.
It will immediately change the wallpaper on every start,
in combination with a high timer value allows the use as a "daily wallpaper" selector.

Persistent wallpaper
-------------------

It uses official Windows API commands to set the wallpaper.
The wallpaper will persist across restarts.

Low memory footprint
--------------------

It will not attempt to load all wallpapers into memory or read directory contents on each swap.
This makes it perfect to read huge wallpaper collections.

Fair random selection
---------------------

The wallpaper is randomly selected.
The algorithm ensures that every image is shown once before reusing one that has already been shown in the past.
This also works across restarts.
